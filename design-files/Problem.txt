Problem to solve:
I need a simple way of quickly separating items and their prices 
from a receipt and a way for each individual to claim an item and 
total up their total from the receipt.

potential improvements:
 - splitting costs between multiple people for certain items 
 - recognizing commonly split items and automatically updating totals
    without a claim 
 - make sending payments easier by connecting to cash apps api
